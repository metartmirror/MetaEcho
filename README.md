# MetaEcho: VR Audio Education System

This repository houses the foundational code for developing MetaEcho, a pioneering system aimed at revolutionizing the way audio engineering and sound recording techniques are taught within a virtual reality (VR) environment.

## Abstract

The intricate nature of sound recording and the complexity of audio equipment operation present considerable challenges within educational frameworks. Traditional pedagogical approaches, which often rely on theoretical instruction and limited hands-on practice due to the high cost and scarce availability of professional audio equipment, do not fully address the needs of learners. In response to these challenges, MetaEcho introduces an immersive VR platform designed to facilitate a comprehensive learning experience in audio engineering. Leveraging the principles of immersion and interactivity, MetaEcho offers users the opportunity to engage with high-fidelity, virtual audio equipment, allowing for the manipulation of a wide range of parameters to simulate real-world recording scenarios. Through a user study involving 24 participants, we have observed that MetaEcho enables more effective learning outcomes, offering enhanced flexibility and fostering creativity in audio engineering education. By significantly reducing the financial and spatial constraints associated with traditional audio education, MetaEcho showcases the transformative potential of VR technologies in enriching the educational landscape for budding audio professionals.

## How to Run

To explore the capabilities of MetaEcho, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the cloned repository with Unity.
3. Navigate to `Assets/Scenes` and open the `MainScene.unity` file to start.

## Scenes

- **MainMenu.unity**: Serves as the gateway to the MetaEcho experience, offering a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to log in, create new sessions, or join existing ones. This scene is the starting point for collaborative and individual learning journeys, designed to smoothly transition users into the immersive world of VR audio education.

- **CrossPlatformNetwork Microphone Photon.unity**: This primary scene is meticulously crafted to simulate a versatile recording studio environment within the VR space. Here, users can delve into the art of sound capture, navigating through a variety of recording setups. The scene empowers users to tweak equipment settings, explore the nuances of microphone placement, and receive real-time auditory feedback, thereby enriching their hands-on learning experience in audio engineering.

MetaEcho aims to redefine the standards of audio education, making it more accessible, effective, and engaging for students across the globe. By immersing learners in a fully interactive VR environment, MetaEcho not only enhances their understanding of complex audio concepts but also prepares them for real-world challenges in the field of sound engineering.
