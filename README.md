# MetaEcho: VR Audio Education System

This repository contains the core code for the development of MetaEcho, an innovative system designed to transform audio engineering and sound recording education through a virtual reality (VR) framework. The program supports **streaming from a computer** using VR equipment or operates as a **standalone application** within the VR environment ([meta_echo_1.3.apk](https://file.io/IrPZVRgVcmVX)). You can find our demo video in the project root directory: `meta_echo_demo_1.3.mp4`.

## Abstract

In film education, high expenses and limited space significantly challenge teaching synchronized sound recording (SSR). Traditional methods, which emphasize theory with limited practical experience, often fail to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. As such, we introduce MetaEcho, an educational virtual reality leveraging the presence theory for teaching SSR. MetaEcho provides realistic simulations of various recording equipment and facilitates communication between learners and instructors, offering an immersive learning experience that closely mirrors actual practices. An evaluation with 24 students demonstrated that MetaEcho surpasses the traditional method in presence, collaboration, usability, comprehensibility, and creativity. Three experts also commented on the benefits of MetaEcho and the opportunities for promoting SSR education in the metaverse era.

## How to Run

To explore the capabilities of MetaEcho, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the cloned repository with Unity.
3. Navigate to `Assets/Scenes` and open the `MainScene.unity` file to start.

## Scenes

- **MainMenu.unity**: Serves as the gateway to the MetaEcho experience, offering a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to log in, create new sessions, or join existing ones. This scene is the starting point for collaborative and individual learning journeys, designed to smoothly transition users into the immersive world of VR audio education.

- **CrossPlatformNetwork Microphone Photon.unity**: This primary scene is meticulously crafted to simulate a versatile recording studio environment within the VR space. Here, users can delve into the art of sound capture, navigating through a variety of recording setups. The scene empowers users to tweak equipment settings, explore the nuances of microphone placement, and receive real-time auditory feedback, thereby enriching their hands-on learning experience in audio engineering.
